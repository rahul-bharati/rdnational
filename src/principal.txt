							R.D. National College, a 66 year old institution, which was established by Sindhi migrants, after being displaced during the partition of India. A district honour was achieved by the college in 2012-2013, by the visit of Dr. Abdul Kalam, forever President of India. His presence and his interaction with the students will remain etched in our memories for many years to come. It is rightly said that
“He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.” (Epicpetus)
